## Introduction

`LegendTerrain` is an in-progress framework that is being designed for procedural environment and terrain generation. This framework will set the foundation for dynamic, expansive, and immersive game worlds.

---

## Planned Features

- **Procedural Generation**: Create vast and diverse terrains on-the-fly.
- **Real-time Manipulation**: Manipulate verticies of the terrain in real-time.
- **Optimized for Performance**: Lazy-loading and modern algorithms to allow for expansive worlds.
- **Customizable Parameters**: Tailor the generation to fit the desired theme or biome through layers of noise as well as allow customizable shaders.
- **Serializable Chunks**: Chunks can be saved or loaded on the fly allowing for worlds to expand up to the integer limit.
